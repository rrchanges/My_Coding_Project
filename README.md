# I am Ravi Ragbir

Welcome to my Github respository page. You are invited to explore my projects. 

## Introduction

In the year 2000, amidst the complexities of the financial industry, I found myself entangled in a situation that drastically altered the course of my life. While working for Household Finance Corporation, a decision I made to approve fraudulent mortgages led to my conviction on wire fraud charges. This moment marked the beginning of a deeply challenging journey, one that tested my resilience, character, and ultimately, redefined my purpose in life.

## Background and Education

Sentenced to three years in federal prison, I was faced with the consequences of my actions in an environment that is often unforgiving. Yet, it is within the confines of adversity that the seeds of change are sown. My time in prison became a period of deep reflection and transformation, an opportunity to look inward and envision a future where my past mistakes would pave the way for meaningful contributions to society.

## Interests and Hobbies

*Upon release and during my battle with Immigration and Customs Services, I discovered a passion for advocacy and helping others facing similar challenges.*

## Professional Experience

Emerging from ICE custody, I embarked on a remarkable journey of advocacy, channeling my experiences into a force for good. Recognizing the fear, confusion, and often, the despair that individuals facing deportation endure, I became an unwavering source of hope and guidance.

## Future Goals

My work as an immigration advocate is not just a careerâ€”it's a calling. It is a powerful reminder that every individual has the potential to make a difference, to turn personal trials into collective triumphs.

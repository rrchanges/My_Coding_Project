                <h3>Who I am and Why I am this Way</h3><br>
                <p>In the year 2000, amidst the complexities of the financial industry, I found myself entangled in a
                    situation that drastically altered the course of my life. While working for Household Finance
                    Corporation, a decision I made to approve fraudulent mortgages led to my conviction on wire fraud
                    charges. This moment marked the beginning of a deeply challenging journey, one that tested my
                    resilience, character, and ultimately, redefined my purpose in life.</p><br>

                <h3>Background and Education</h3><br>
                <p>Sentenced to three years in federal prison, I was faced with the consequences of my actions in an
                    environment that is often unforgiving. Yet, it is within the confines of adversity that the seeds of
                    change are sown. My time in prison became a period of deep reflection and transformation, an
                    opportunity to look inward and envision a future where my past mistakes would pave the way for
                    meaningful contributions to society.</p><br>

                <h3>Interests</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Upon release and during my battle with Immigration and Customs Services, I discovered a passion
                    for advocacy and helping others facing similar challenges.

            <section id="experience">
                <h3>Professional Experience</h3><br>
                <p>Emerging from ICE custody, I embarked on a remarkable journey of advocacy, channeling my experiences
                    into a force for good. Recognizing the fear, confusion, and often, the despair that individuals
                    facing
                    deportation endure, I became an unwavering source of hope and guidance.</p><br>

                <h3>Future Goals</h3><br>
                <p>My work as an immigration advocate is not just a career—it's a calling. It is a powerful reminder
                    that every individual has the potential to make a difference, to turn personal trials into
                    collective
                    triumphs.</p><br>
